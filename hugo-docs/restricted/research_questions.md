- Comparison of LEO, GEO and Wired Internet Technology

- How high is the packet loss?
	- Measure in percent
	- Use Ping Measurement on RIPE
	- Previous papers reported in high packet loss in Starlink
- How does the routing look like in Starlink?
	- Can we make assumptions about the enablement of ISLs?
	- look at the Starlink Firmware (at least what is out there)
- What is the latency of different internet technologies?
