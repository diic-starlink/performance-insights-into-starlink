# Starlink and the Future of Low-Orbit Internet

- "Sweet Spot" for satellite signals: ~450 km altitude
	- earth expands during solar storms, therefore not lower possible

## Starlink

- For Starlink, the country needs to be signed up for Starlink
- Equipment needed:
	- Antenna
	- Modem
	- Cabels
	- And then you are connected ...
- Allows access all over the world (where it is available)
- Starlink has competitive advantage:
	- Rockets are reusable
	- Rockets do not have to be rebuilt after launch
	- Drops price per kg massively
- Starlink satellites move rather quickly
	- Often switching the use of the satellite
	- Is that the cause for high packet loss?
- How do Starlink Beams work?
	- Usually each satellite has a square "Beam"
	- Center of Beam ⇾ high bit rates
	- Fringes of Beam ⇾ lower bit rates
- Due to the nature of the signal, high packet loss
- A constant shift every 15 seconds
	- Needs relogging every time a new satellite is used
	- Tuning the protocol is possible for highly specific traffic
	- But for general setup, not good as tuning is not a possibility
- To see where Starlink's weaknesses are: Push a lot of traffic!
	- Takes a lot of time and different satellites will be used

## Security

- Big problem: Jamming
	- Sending an own Beam and intercepting legitimate use
- Problem with security
