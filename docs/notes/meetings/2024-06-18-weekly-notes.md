# Weekly Meeting Notes 18.06.2024
with Vaibhav

- daily pattern
- weekly patterns
- boxplots
- correlate latencies with launched satellites
- how is latency measured with CF?
	- protocol, ipv4, ipv6
	- primary AS, secondary AS
	- correlate with countries?
- boxplot on the RIPE ATLAS latencies
	- could also be a heatmap
	- differentiate by server
	- rephrase latency to ping
	- correlate data with number of hops
- why do some countries have higher latencies than others
- correlate latency with number of ground stations
	- more ground stations, less latencies
- disconnection events:
	- what is a disconnection event? Heartsbeats? Pings? Protocol?
	- length of the connection events as main metric
	- draw as cdf
	- correlate with performance data
	- filter out software probes
- packet loss:
	- more fine grained
	- show per timeframe
	- correlation of countries and time and measurement
- always start with the CDF for every kind of metric
- OONI censorship with Starlink
