10.09.2024

- Idea: Turn the thesis into a paper.

## Content Ideas

### TLS Analysis

- latency is much higher than anticipated
- "Double Bell"-Pattern
	- about the pattern that occurrs when plotting latencies in histograms
	- also visible in CDFs
	- appears in each country
- comparison of years: 2022 vs. 2023 vs. 2024
	- 2022 & 2024 were good, but 2023 was bad
	- 2024 was not better than 2022

### Packet Loss

- report about numbers per country per year

### Correlation of Latency & Packet Loss

- Correlate the following two per country:
	- median latency per month
	- overall packet loss per month
- No correlation found
	- however, we expected to find one

### Positioning of Starlink Devices

- Idea: Compare:
	- where Starlink devices are found
	- where Starlink devices are officially services
	- where Starlink devices are claimed to be (data by IP Info)
	- this is an idea of Vasilis
- Ethical concern:
	- Starlink poses a governmental concern in some countries where internet poses a threat to the government
	- If we give instructions on how to find people with Starlink, this is not good!
	- this is a guide on how to get people in trouble
