25.07.2024

## Participants

- Robert Richter
- David McGee (IP Info)

## Notes

### Why is this interesting for IP Info?

- IP Info is very interested in the topic of finding geolocation for satellite data
	- currently, that is a very big problem
	- IP Info is very interested in any satellite network research
	- want to share their data with us
	- they will set up a meeting with Oliver and / or Max
- if they can solve this, they will make loads of money (future collab for chair?)
- we can get a research quota of around 5 million requests
- we need to sign a research agreement

### Datasets

- Data that IP Info provides is shown in [IP Info Datasets](./ipinfo-datasets.pdf).

### Why IP Info?

- IP Info provides IP data for IPs all over the world
- BUT they have probes in 300+ cities that probe IP addresses (including China and Iran!)
- Therefore, they do not simply have a database with IP addresses, but regularly
  validate the correctness of their data
- However, he mentioned that data is not 100% correct. They try to get correct data,
  but guarantees are not there of course.
- But they try to and verify as much as they can. Still contradiction with data from
  other vendors might appear.

### Student Collaborations

- they have a program for students that should advertise IP Info as vendor
  for future companies students work in
- therefore, IP Info is willing to work with students
