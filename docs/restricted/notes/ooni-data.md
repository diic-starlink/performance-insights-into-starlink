# OONI Data

[OONI](https://ooni.torproject.org/) is a project that collects data on internet censorship. It measures whether websites are blocked and tries to therefore determine a censorship from a country.

In the terms of Starlink, no special behavior is observed. The censorship is the same as with most other networks too.

## Availability of Starlink in Censored Countries

Countries that are known for their censorship are:

- China
- Russia
- Iran
- North Korea
- Saudi Arabia

However, Starlink is not officially available in these countries and therefore do not have data on it.

Concerning the [Psiphon Test](https://ooni.org/nettest/psiphon) (a test whether Psiphon, a popular VPN provider for uncensored internet access, is available in a country), Starlink does not block actively Psiphon. However, it also does not pose any special behavior towards enabling it.
For example, in the Philippines, the Psiphon test concurrently fails. This does not change by using Starlink.

TODO: Add a chart that shows Psiphon test results in different countries.
