How do Starlink Beams work? Usually each satellite has a square \u0026ldquo;Beam\u0026rdquo; Center of Beam ⇾ high bit rates Fringes of Beam ⇾ lower bit rates Due to the nature of the signal, high packet loss A constant shift every 15 seconds Needs relogging every time a new satellite is used Tuning the protocol is possible for highly specific traffic But for general setup, not good as tuning is not a possibility To see where Starlink\u0026rsquo;s weaknesses are: Push a lot of traffic!
