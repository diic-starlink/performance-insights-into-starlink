Bent-Pipe and ISLs # routing can theoretically involve ISLs or not if routing does not involve ISLs, it transmits data back and forth between ground-stations and satellites that is called \u0026ldquo;bent-pipe\u0026rdquo; routing can also involve ISLs, which allows transmission between satellites without any ground stations in-between Results # Paper found that ISLs offer an improvement compared to bent-pipe routing Paper measures absolute RTT of 5000 city pairs in intervals of 15 min RTT for ISL were more stable and better More stable, less RTT with ISLs "},{"id":1,"href":"/restricted/notes/podcast_starlink/","title":"Podcast Starlink","section":"Restricted Section Homepage","content":" Starlink and the Future of Low-Orbit Internet # \u0026ldquo;Sweet Spot\u0026rdquo; for satellite signals: ~450 km altitude earth expands during solar storms, therefore not lower possible Starlink # For Starlink, the country needs to be signed up for Starlink Equipment needed: Antenna Modem Cabels And then you are connected \u0026hellip; Allows access all over the world (where it is available) Starlink has competitive advantage: Rockets are reusable Rockets do not have to be rebuilt after launch Drops price per kg massively Starlink satellites move rather quickly Often switching the use of the satellite Is that the cause for high packet loss? How do Starlink Beams work? Usually each satellite has a square \u0026ldquo;Beam\u0026rdquo; Center of Beam ⇾ high bit rates Fringes of Beam ⇾ lower bit rates Due to the nature of the signal, high packet loss A constant shift every 15 seconds Needs relogging every time a new satellite is used Tuning the protocol is possible for highly specific traffic But for general setup, not good as tuning is not a possibility To see where Starlink\u0026rsquo;s weaknesses are: Push a lot of traffic!
