	% TODO: Find better phrasing for the last enumaration of disadvantages
	The modern internet brought up many different networking technologies. For example, glass fiber has proven as a reliable networking technology. However, it has severe disadvantages, e.g., communication needs to cross country borders, building glass fiber infrastructure is highly expensive for sparsely populated areas, and cables are highly vulnerable.

	A different possibility is to route communication over satellites. This allows reaching a major part of the earth's population without tedious construction of networking infrastructure. Also, it is less prone to catastrophes, which caused governments to construct networked satellite infrastructure themselves. In addition, private institutions constructed their networks for business usage, e.g., \textit{Starlink}, \textit{O3b}, or \textit{Hughesnet}.

	% TODO: Last phrase needs to align with RQs.
	This proposal describes the approach of the master's thesis \textit{"Evaluating Resiliency and Performance of Networked Satellite Systems"} to analyze different networked satellite systems in terms of resiliency and performance. It will put a special emphasis on routing behavior of networked satellite systems. Additionally, it measures latency and packet loss to compare them with wired internet technologies.
