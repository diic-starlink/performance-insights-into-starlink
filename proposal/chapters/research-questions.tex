\noindent \textbf{RQ: How do networked satellite systems perform in terms of latency and packet loss?}

Previous work \cite{DBLP:conf/imc/MichelTGB22, DBLP:conf/infocom/MaCZCML23, Segan2020} showed first results for latency, \ac{RTT}, throughput, packet loss. However, networked satellite systems are a cutting edge technology that changes frequently. Therefore, it is worth taking a look if significant changes occurred. \\

\noindent \textbf{RQ: How do networked satellite systems perform efficient routing?}

In theory, satellites should integrate well in the existing internet architecture. However, it proved to be not the case. Especially the problem of a high packet loss \cite{DBLP:conf/infocom/MaCZCML23} poses problems as a continuous connection cannot be guaranteed. It should be determined show networked satellite systems currently route packets and how it should be done.
