% Outline:
% - Current standard: wired networking technology
%	- [Add papers on wired networking technology - glass fiber]
%	- "gold standard": Glass fiber (transmits data at the speed of light)
%	- problem: expensive infrastructure, country borders, prone to risk [Paper] --> easy to attack wiring
%	- idea: solve most of these problems by putting up satellites which take over communication
%	- depending on height of satellite, it covers a big part of the earth's population
%	- with an antenna only, one could receive and transmit messages easily
% - Good idea, and governments already put up their networked satellite systems in order to have a fallback
%   in case some disaster appears.
%	- but not intended for the broad population
%	- intended for emergencies where little people use the system
% - in recent times, also businesses tried to use this idea and put their system up in the space, e.g,. HughesNet, ViaSat and Starlink
%	- but little is known, how well that actually works
%	- it was found that the height of satellites is the first influence
%		- GEO Satellites: Satellites at very high altitude
%		- LEO Satellites: Satellites at very low altitude
%	- Usually, GEO Satellites have a very high latency and cannot compete with LEO systems
%		- [Papers with Numbers for GEO and LEO]
%	- [Add papers that measure Starlink]
