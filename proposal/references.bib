	abstract = {Effective benchmarking requires standards for measuring
               performance across a broad range of organizations.
               Industry-benchmarking measures the relative performance levels of
               similar operations, but gathering sufficient data to robustly
               characterize best performance is the primary hurdle to more
               widespread implementation. This paper describes the development of
               an innovative, large-scale benchmarking methodology which employs
               Internet technology to overcome the data collection problem. We
               discuss a particular instance of this approach, iDEAs-W-the result
               of an ongoing collaboration between academia and the warehousing
               industry. This paper's purpose is to demonstrate the methodology
               for the warehousing industry and share our insights to allow
               others to refine the tool for applications in other industries. {\copyright}

	abstract = {Wired broadband access can be realized using various technologies
               , configurations and protocols. It is widely deployed and able to
               provide both high data rates and high reliability. These features
               are of strong importance for many advanced applications. Since the
               number of broadband subscribers worldwide grows exponentially, the
               power efficiency of access networks becomes an important issue.
               The main goal of this paper is to study the power consumption of
               different wired broadband access technologies including both those
               already widely used and those which are state-of-the art, but not
               yet widely deployed. Thus, results on power efficiency of
               different access networks such as hybrid fiber coax (HFC), digital
               subscriber line (DSL), 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s point-to-point
               Ethernet and passive optical networks (1G-PON and 10G-PON) are
               shown. {\copyright} 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract   = {This paper summarizes current state-of-the-art navigation results
               with multi-constellation low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite signals
               of opportunity. Experimental results with four LEO satellite
               constellations are presented: Starlink, OneWeb, Orbcomm, and
               Iridium. Two receiver designs are presented: (R1) a cognitive
               opportunistic navigation approach, which utilizes minimal,
               publicly available prior knowledge about the LEO satellite signal
               structure and (R2) a blind approach, which assumes no prior
               knowledge of the signals. Stationary positioning and mobile ground
               vehicle navigation results are presented. For the ground vehicle,
               results with two frameworks are presented: (N1) a LEO-aided
               inertial navigation system (INS) simultaneous tracking and
               navigation (STAN) and (N2) a LEO-aided differential STAN. The
               results reveal the tremendous promise of exploiting
               multi-constellation LEO satellite signals of opportunity for
               navigation. For positioning: (i) with R1, starting with an initial
               estimate about 179 km away, by exploiting signals from 6 Starlink,
               1 Orbcomm, and 4 Iridium, a final two-dimensional (2-D) position
               error of 6.5 m was achieved and (ii) with R2, starting with an
               initial estimate about 3,600 km away, by exploiting signals from 4
               Starlink, 2 OneWeb, 1 Orbcomm, and 1 Iridium, a final 2-D position
               error of 5.1 m was achieved. For navigation, a ground vehicle was
               equipped with an industrial-grade inertial measurement unit (IMU)
               and an altimeter. (i) With R1 and N1, the vehicle traversed 4.15
               km in 150 seconds (GNSS signals were only available for the first
               2.33 km). By exploiting signals from 3 Starlink, 2 Orbcomm, and 1
               Iridium, the 3-D position root mean squared error (RMSE) and final
               3-D error were 18.4 m and 27.1 m, respectively. The GNSS-aided INS
               position RMSE and final 3-D error were 118.5 m and 472.7 m,
               respectively. (ii) With R2 and N2, the vehicle traversed 1.03 km
               in 110 seconds (GNSS signals were only available for the first
               0.11 km). By exploiting signals from 4 Starlink, 1 OneWeb, 2
               Orbcomm, and 1 Iridium, the 3-D position RMSE and final 3-D error
               were 9.5 m and 4.4 m, respectively. The GNSS-aided INS position
               RMSE and final 3-D error were 205 m and 525 m, respectively.},

               for wireless local area networking in both business and home
               environments. Even though it was designed primarily for private

               the major future market opportunity for WiFi, but in order to take
               advantage of it, several key challenges, both technical and

               planning satellite constellations to offer broadband Internet
               service. While these developments are happening quickly, there are
               also many uncertainties about the design of these networks. A key
               open question is whether or not they will incorporate direct
               connectivity between satellites, instead of only ground-satellite
               connections. We compare the network behavior resulting from the
               two outcomes of that question. Our analysis shows that
               inter-satellite links substantially reduce the temporal variations
               in latency, add greater resilience to weather, and could yield
               more than 3x the throughput achieved without such links. Thus,
               whether this one design element pans out could have a large
               bearing on the performance, reliability, and economics of these
               networks.},
