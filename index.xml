      <description> &amp;ldquo;Internet From Space&amp;rdquo; without Inter-satellite Links? # See Paper&#xA;ISLs should be commonly integrated in Starlink However, no real proof of that. in 2020, devices for ISLs were removed from satellites How is the state now? Bent-Pipe and ISLs # routing can theoretically involve ISLs or not if routing does not involve ISLs, it transmits data back and forth between ground-stations and satellites that is called &amp;ldquo;bent-pipe&amp;rdquo; routing can also involve ISLs, which allows transmission between satellites without any ground stations in-between Results # Paper found that ISLs offer an improvement compared to bent-pipe routing Paper measures absolute RTT of 5000 city pairs in intervals of 15 min RTT for ISL were more stable and better More stable, less RTT with ISLs </description>

      <description>Starlink and the Future of Low-Orbit Internet # &amp;ldquo;Sweet Spot&amp;rdquo; for satellite signals: ~450 km altitude earth expands during solar storms, therefore not lower possible Starlink # For Starlink, the country needs to be signed up for Starlink Equipment needed: Antenna Modem Cabels And then you are connected &amp;hellip; Allows access all over the world (where it is available) Starlink has competitive advantage: Rockets are reusable Rockets do not have to be rebuilt after launch Drops price per kg massively Starlink satellites move rather quickly Often switching the use of the satellite Is that the cause for high packet loss?</description>

      <description>Research Questions # Comparison of LEO, GEO and Wired Internet Technology&#xA;How high is the packet loss?&#xA;Measure in percent Use Ping Measurement on RIPE Previous papers reported in high packet loss in Starlink How does the routing look like in Starlink?&#xA;Can we make assumptions about the enablement of ISLs? look at the Starlink Firmware (at least what is out there) What is the latency of different internet technologies?</description>
