\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related_work}

Lately, much research aimed at determining the performance of networked satellite systems.

Chan and Barboza reported of failing companies that tried to build a working networked satellite system in the early 2000s \cite{Chan2002, Barboza2000}.
Michel~et~al. did first measurements finding deficiencies in terms of packet loss \cite{DBLP:conf/imc/MichelTGB22}.
Ma~et~al. looked at the performance of different public services connected via Starlink \cite{DBLP:conf/infocom/MaCZCML23}.
