\section{Latency Development on Individual Days} \label{sec:latency-individual-days}

We used the data to look at the latency development over a single data for individual days.
For that we used the built-in ping measurements taken in RIPE Atlas probes\footnote{Ping measurements are not representative for absolute numbers \cite{DBLP:conf/imc/PelsserCVB13}, but show a pattern.}.
