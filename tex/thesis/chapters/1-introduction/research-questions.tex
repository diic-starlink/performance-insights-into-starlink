\section{Research Questions} \label{sec:research-questions}

In the following thesis, we want to solve the following research questions.

\begin{rqbox}{1: How do networked satellite systems perform in terms of latency and packet loss?}
	Packet loss and latency are the main factors for the performance of a network.
	Recent research stated high packet loss values, but mostly idealized latency values.
	This thesis shall take a look at those two performance characteristics.
\end{rqbox}

\begin{rqbox}{2: Do latency and packet loss correlate?}
	It is expected that a rising latency correlates with a rising packet loss and vice versa due to the need of retransmits.
	It is in question whether this is the case for networked satellite systems.

	If it appears that there is no clear correlation observable, what factors might influence the correlation?
\end{rqbox}

\begin{rqbox}{3: How do networked satellite systems route?}
	Networked satellite systems face a severe challenge when routing a packet.
	Additionally, to the routing problem, they need to find an ideal route through their
	satellite constellation involving sending data to a ground station.

	This thesis takes a look at the routing behavior of networked satellite systems.
\end{rqbox}
