\section{Thesis Outline}

This thesis is structured as follows.

Chapter \ref{sec:introduction} introduces the topic and outlines the thesis. We
define the research questions that we want to solve with the thesis. Also, we
present related work that has already researched properties of \ac{SNO}s.

In Chapter \ref{sec:background}, we talk about the basic concepts of satellite
communication. We explain the schematics of networking in a satellite
constellation, but do not explain the physical layer of the technology.
Additionally, we outline the use-cases of satellite communication and list
companies being active in the field.

Advancing to the results part of the thesis, we first introduce our
methodology. In~Chapter~\ref{sec:methodology}, we explain how we obtained our
measurement results. We use the data measured by RIPE~Atlas, Cloudflare~Radar,
and N2YO. Further platforms offering more data are OONI and M-Lab. However, we
do not explore them in this thesis.

In Chapter~\ref{sec:results}, we analyze the measurements results. We use
various metrics like packet loss, latency, disconnect events, and more. The
data is analyzed for their historic development (January 2022 to June 2024) as
well for the geographical differences.

We conclude in Chapter~\ref{sec:conclusion}. We answer the research
questions to the most part with the results from the previous chapter and
outline where additional work is required.
