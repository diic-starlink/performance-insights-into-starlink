\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related-work}

Networked satellite operators exist for quite a while, starting the late 90s,
when Iridium launched their plans to deploy a mega satellite constellation
\cite{Chan2002}. Even if their plan did not work out, modern times face newer
technologies, giving other providers the possibility to achieve what Iridium
couldn't. With the rise of Starlink, OneWeb, Orbcomm, and others, research has
made steps to figuring out how "satellite internet" might work well in the
future. In 2020, research started to make their first steps by building the
first mega constellation simulators (Hypatia and Starperf
\cite{DBLP:conf/icnp/LaiLL20, DBLP:conf/imc/KassingBASS20}). However, the
direction was not further explored as it become apparent that those simulators
do not depict the reality. Therefore, research turned to performing
measurements on existing constellations. Performance of networked satellite
operators was presented in \cite{Segan2020, DBLP:conf/infocom/MaCZCML23,
	Pekhterev2021, DBLP:journals/pacmnet/RamanVCSZ23, DBLP:conf/leo-net/0001SCB23,
	DBLP:conf/imc/MichelTGB22, DBLP:conf/www/MohanFCBRMO24, Izhikevich2024,
	Omorogiuwa2024}. However, it has to be noted that most measurements on existing
systems were performed on the Starlink constellation, due to low cost and high
availability, even for non-business customers. Resilience against catastrophes
has been described by Stevens~et~al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/pam/StevensIBD24}. It is
also worthwhile mentioning the influence of weather
\cite{DBLP:conf/tma/LaniewskiLMRA24}, mobility
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2403-13497}, and solar magnetic storms
\cite{DBLP:conf/infocom/MaCZCML23, Fang2022, Hapgood2022}. All these factors
have to be taken into consideration when performing routing
\cite{DBLP:conf/hotnets/Handley18, DBLP:journals/comcom/ZhangY22,
	DBLP:conf/pam/BhosaleSBG23} in a satellite constellation. This includes looking
at \ac{ISL}s \cite{DBLP:conf/hotnets/HauriBGS20, Stock2022}, the navigation of
satellites \cite{DBLP:conf/plans/KassasKKSHNKK23,DBLP:conf/iotbd/ShortenKR24},
and the positioning of \ac{GS}s \cite{DBLP:conf/sigcomm/VasishtSC21}.

In perfect conditions, this might supplement 6G deployment
\cite{DBLP:journals/cm/LinCCCHB21}. However, the most dominant problem is the
lack of knowledge about the functionality of Starlink. Therefore, people tried
to extract the firmware \cite{WoutersDumpingUserTerminalFirmware,
	QuarkslabsBlogUserTerminalFirmsware} in a thesis and consequent papers.

Also, with the start of the war in Ukraine, people observed a new problem with
satellite communication being used in conflicts as they are independent of a
terrestrial infrastructure in the conflict zone \cite{Lab2024, Walsh2024,
	Abels2024}.
