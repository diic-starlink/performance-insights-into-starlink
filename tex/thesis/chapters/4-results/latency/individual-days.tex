\subsection{Latency Development on Individual Days} \label{sec:latency-individual-days}

We used the data to look at the latency development over a single data for
individual days. First, TLS data was used to analyze individual days. However,
it appeared that the amount of TLS measurements per hour was insufficient to
make a reasonable statement. An example of such a plot for July 9, 2024 is
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:tls-analysis-individual-day} in the
appendix\footnote{The day was chosen at random. It holds more data than most of
	the other days.}.

Instead, we chose to use Ping data for the analysis of individual days. Ping
measurements are not representative for absolute performance metrics
\cite{DBLP:conf/imc/PelsserCVB13}, but show a pattern.
