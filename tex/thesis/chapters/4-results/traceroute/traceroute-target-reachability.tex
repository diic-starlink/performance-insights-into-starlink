\subsection{Reachability of Target Servers}

The data contains various target servers. However, running a traceroute to them
is not similarly successful. \Cref{fig:traceroute-success-rates} shows the
traceroute results for servers with at least one successful traceroute.

\begin{table}
	\footnotesize
	\caption{Success Rates of Traceroute per Target Server}
	\label{fig:traceroute-success-rates}
	\begin{tabular}{llrrr}

		  & Destination    & Success Events & Total Events & Success Rate \\

\end{table}

One sees that most servers have 34~\% to 37~\% success rate. However, \#1, \#2,
and \#8 have far lower success rates with less than 10~\%. It is unclear why
such a behavior appear, but similar was reported by
Brownlee~\cite{Brownlee2021}. However, his numbers were higher than the ones
here. The numbers are still not comparable, as Brownlee performed the tests on
an earlier time series (2012~--2019) and not specifically for Starlink probes.

\begin{table}
	\footnotesize
	\caption{Servers that were never reached during a Traceroute Measurement}
	\label{fig:unreachable-servers}
	\begin{tabular}{l}
		\toprule
		Destination     \\
		\midrule
		193.0.19.60     \\
		170.247.170.2   \\
		104.237.152.132 \\
		198.41.0.4      \\
		45.33.72.12     \\
		139.162.27.28   \\
		78.46.48.134    \\
		193.0.19.59     \\
		213.133.109.134 \\
		199.9.14.201    \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Still, it becomes apparent that some servers do not even accept traceroutes.
\Cref{fig:unreachable-servers} lists those servers that never got a successful
traceroute.
