\subsection{Traceroute Analysis} \label{sec:traceroute-analysis}

Looking at traceroute results, we can make conclusions about the routing
behavior of Starlink network devices. In the data we gathered more than forty
million traceroute measurements. Those include primarily built-in measurements
from RIPE Atlas probes to \textit{*.root-servers.net} for Starlink probes
(\ac{ASN} 14593).

\subsection*{Routing Behavior}

\end{figure}

First, we found that the satellite hops are likely invisible to the traceroute.
We conclude that as there are no hops visible above water, even for probes
located in remote regions, e.g., Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean. In
Figure~\ref{fig:kiribati-example-traceroute}, one can see a visualization of a
traceroute result from Kiribati to \textit{f.root-servers.net}. One can see
that the first visible hop is located in New~Zealand or an island to the north
of New~Zealand. However, if satellites were visible, we'd be able to observe
more satellites.

% TODO: Cite the statement that 4000km is too large for a single satellite. Everybody would ask here now: "But how much can they actually cover?"
Coming from the first insight, we can also conclude that \ac{ISLs} are enabled.
If they were not, we would likely not be able to see a successful traceroute
from Kiribati to a location. The next closest known \ac{PoP} is on Hawaii.
However, the distance between both is 4000~km, which is more than a single
satellite can cover \cite{Pekhterev2021}. Aside from that, we do not observe the usage of the
\ac{PoP} in Hawaii, but in more distant locations, which just strengthens the
argument. Therefore, we conclude that \ac{ISLs} are enabled. This is special
interest, as it was not clear in recent research \cite{DBLP:conf/hotnets/HauriBGS20}.

	no proof or no privacy concern}

\subsection*{Privacy Concerns in Traceroute Data}

One of the most important responsibilities of an \ac{ISP} is to ensure the
privacy of its users. This also includes to route traffic only in trusted
countries. In the case of Starlink, we were able to observe a different
behavior. We looked at a slice of the built-in traceroute measurements from
German Starlink probes and analyzed their most common targets. We filtered for
anycasted servers (e.g., *.root-servers.net) and bogon IPs (i.e., IPs that
cannot be associated with metadata).

In Table~\ref{fig:ip-hitlist-traceroute}, the top twenty most frequent hits of
IP addresses are shown. The IP addresses are joined with data from IPinfo. As
traffic goes from a German probe to an anycasted server, located in Germany,
one would expect little traffic outside Germany, and none outside Europe. The
top five IP addresses are located within or close to Germany, but the next five
already involve traffic to the United~States. Here, we observe an unexpected
behavior. Assuming that the data is not flawed, this is a clear violation of
guiding privacy principles.
