\section{Reproducibility of Results and Data} \label{sec:reproducibility}

The code to reproduce the results and data is uploaded to GitHub\footnote{See \url{https://github.com/starlink-thesis-diic/starlink-thesis}}. The user is only required to have a running internet connection and an installation of Nix and Docker. Follow the instructions provided by the repository to obtain the results and data by yourself\footnote{The scripts might not work, if data format in the sources has changed since the last update of the scripts.}.
