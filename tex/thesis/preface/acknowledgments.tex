To everybody who supported me in my work, thank you very much! Especially I'd
like to thank the Villenbewohner, Tobi, Jonas, Luc, Lara, Fabi, and Moritz, for
all the great time we had. The endless table football sessions, where we held
the moral high every other day and took care of the Villa, after we had a
coffee too much.

Also, I'd like to highlight the valuable learnings the Vasilis and Vaibhav
allowed me to have and for this interesting topic.
