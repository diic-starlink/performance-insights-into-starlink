The modern time experiences a rapid evolution in the area of satellite internet
access. However, it is unclear how well those systems actually work and what we
can realistically expect from internet access via satellites. Previous research
already looked at their performance and resilience and found several drawbacks.
In this work, we will continue on that and take a closer look on the properties
of the Starlink satellite network operator. We explore the TLS handshake
latency, packet loss, and diurnal latency variation of it and try to determine
a correlation between latency, packet loss, and other important factors. For
that, we use historic data recorded on RIPE~Atlas and Cloudflare~Radar from
January~2022 to June~2024. In the end, we were not able to find a correlation
between latency and packet loss, but found a surprising pattern showing that
Starlink serves specific latencies better than others. Also, our findings
contradict popular research stating far worse performance of Starlink with
median latencies of 80~ms. Additionally, we find strong geographical
differences, where even highly developed countries like Germany experience
packet loss ratios of more than 10\%.
