Our modern era is experiencing a rapid evolution in the area of satellite
internet access. However, it is unclear how well these systems actually work
and what we can realistically expect from internet access via satellites.
Previous research has already looked at their performance and resilience and
found several drawbacks. In this work, we will continue these aims as we take a
closer look at the properties of the Starlink satellite network operator. We
explore the TLS handshake latency, packet loss, and the diurnal latency
variation and try to determine a correlation between latency, packet loss, and
other important factors. For this, we use historic data recorded on RIPE~Atlas
and Cloudflare~Radar from January~2022 to June~2024. In the end, we were not
able to find a correlation between latency and packet loss, but found a
surprising pattern showing that Starlink serves specific latencies better than
others. Also, our findings contradict popular research stating a much worse
performance of Starlink with median latencies of 80~ms. Additionally, we find
strong geographical differences, where even highly developed countries like
Germany experience packet loss ratios of more than 10\%.
