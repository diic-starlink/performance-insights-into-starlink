  abstract = {Effective benchmarking requires standards for measuring
              performance across a broad range of organizations.
              Industry-benchmarking measures the relative performance levels of
              similar operations, but gathering sufficient data to robustly
              characterize best performance is the primary hurdle to more
              widespread implementation. This paper describes the development of
              an innovative, large-scale benchmarking methodology which employs
              Internet technology to overcome the data collection problem. We
              discuss a particular instance of this approach, iDEAs-W-the result
              of an ongoing collaboration between academia and the warehousing
              industry. This paper's purpose is to demonstrate the methodology
              for the warehousing industry and share our insights to allow others
              to refine the tool for applications in other industries. {

  abstract = {Wired broadband access can be realized using various technologies
              , configurations and protocols. It is widely deployed and able to
              provide both high data rates and high reliability. These features
              are of strong importance for many advanced applications. Since the
              number of broadband subscribers worldwide grows exponentially, the
              power efficiency of access networks becomes an important issue. The
              main goal of this paper is to study the power consumption of
              different wired broadband access technologies including both those
              already widely used and those which are state-of-the art, but not
              yet widely deployed. Thus, results on power efficiency of different
              access networks such as hybrid fiber coax (HFC), digital subscriber
              line (DSL), 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s point-to-point Ethernet and
              passive optical networks (1G-PON and 10G-PON) are shown. {

  abstract = {WiFi, also known as 802.11b, has become the preferred technology
              for wireless local area networking in both business and home
              environments. Even though it was designed primarily for private
              applications, WiFi is also being deployed in public places to
              create so-called hotspots, where WiFi-capable users can obtain
              broadband Internet access. This new domain of application could be
              the major future market opportunity for WiFi, but in order to take
              advantage of it, several key challenges, both technical and
              business-related, must be overcome. In this article we outline
              these challenges and discuss approaches to solutions.},
