# Satellite Numbers per Constellation

It is in question how many satellites each private company has up there and how the numbers developed. This tool uses the [Norad Database](https://n2yo.com/database) to count the satellites. Additionally, it processes the the data for the following satellite constellations:

- OneWeb
- Galileo
- Iridium
- Navstar
- Orbcomm
- IntelSat
- Starlink

## Results

In the end, the following development results:
