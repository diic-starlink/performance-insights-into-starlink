\section{Data Access on RIPE ATLAS} \label{sec:dataaccess_ripeatlas}

RIPE ATLAS offers a couple alternatives of accessing measurement data. First, RIPE ATLAS provides auto-generated charts on their website. Additionally, users can download the data as a compressed package.
However, this is not feasible for a larger amount of data. Usually, APIs offer a more structured way to access the data. RIPE ATLAS offers two APIs: a REST API and a Streaming API. The REST API allows accessing all measurements, mainly for previously recorded data. The Streaming API is designed to continuously stream new measurements.
